## 🎯 Project Objective

Students often face difficulty finding authentic academic materials in one place. Information like syllabus PDFs, PYQs, and exam tips are scattered or unavailable. This project aims to build a platform that:

- Organizes syllabus and PYQs department-wise
- Includes student feedback on exam papers (e.g., difficulty levels, important topics)
- Connects juniors with seniors for mentoring and doubt clearing
- Supports **multiple universities and departments** in one place

---

## 🌟 Key Features (To Be Developed)

- ✅ Filter syllabus and papers by **university**, **semester**, **subject**
- ✅ **Student feedback** section for each paper (e.g., "Paper was tricky — focus on Unit 2")
- ✅ Secure **senior-student chat** or forum system
- ✅ Upload and browse **notes, guides, and important questions**
- ✅ Clean and **mobile-friendly** interface
