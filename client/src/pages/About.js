              <p>
                At StudyMatePlus, we believe that every student deserves access to quality 
                educational resources. Our mission is to democratize exam preparation by 
                creating an open-source platform that brings together syllabus materials, 
                previous year questions, exam feedback, and peer-to-peer learning opportunities.
              </p>
              <p>
                We're committed to breaking down barriers in education and ensuring that 
                geographical limitations or resource constraints don't hinder a student's 
                academic success.

              <p>
                Students often struggle to find authentic academic materials scattered across 
                different sources. Critical resources like syllabus PDFs, previous year papers, 
                and exam insights are either unavailable or difficult to access when needed most.
